# LambdaCalculator

To Use Code:

The README is split into multiple sections, all of which can be found below. To run the tool, you'll need: <br /> 
    - At least Java 1.7  <br />
    - Python3  <br />
    - ANTLR (installation instructions below)  <br />
    - FLASK (installation instructions below)  <br />
  <br />
Install and setup ANTLR4  <br />
    - To do this, you'll need at least Java 1.7 installed (since the back-end of ANTLR is Java and not Python)  <br />
    - Follow the steps in this link in section "1. Setup ANTLR" https://tomassetti.me/antlr-mega-tutorial/#setup-antlr <br /> 
    - Get ANTLR for python using "pip install antlr4-python3-runtime" (using a virtual environment if you want - see steps at the bottom of this README section)  <br />
    - Run the following commands from the main directory containing the LambdaCalculus.g4 file  <br />
        antlr4 LambdaCalculus.g4  <br />
        antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 LambdaCalculus.g4 -visitor  <br />
    - OPTIONAL: To view an abstract syntax tree of a lambda term do: <br /> 
        antl4 -Dlanguage=Java LambdaCalculus.g4  <br />
        javac *.java  <br />
        grun LambdaCalculus term -gui  <br />
        -- and then type a lambda term, press enter, and then hit CTRL-Z --  <br />
        -- The abstract syntax tree will appear in a separate window --  <br />
    - OPTIONAL: To run the code from the command line, run "python LambdaCalculus.py", enter either "a", "v", or "n" for alpha-reduction, call-by-value or call-by-name, then enter your lambda term which is to be reduced. The resultant expression will appear  <br />
    For more information on ANTLR, look at https://tomassetti.me/antlr-mega-tutorial/#setup-antlr  <br />
  <br />
Install FLASK - using a virtual environemnt if you want (see below) (recommended) <br /> 
    - Once you have a virtual environment (optional) run "pip install flask" to get FLASK  <br />
    - Then do "flask run" to get the webpage up and running  <br />
    - Visit "localhost:5000" in a browser to view the webpage  <br />

  <br />
INSTALLING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT -- Windows  <br />
- From the command line, navigate to the code directory  <br />
- Run "python3 -m venv venv"  <br />
- Run "venv\Scripts\activate"  <br />
- You should now have a virtual environment up and running  <br />
For more information, or for instructions on MAC, refer to the virtual environment steps in the following links:  <br />
